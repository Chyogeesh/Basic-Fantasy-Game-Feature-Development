# Basic-Fantasy-Game-Feature-Development
Assignment 
Overview:

This project involves developing a simple fantasy game feature where users can create and manage their fantasy teams, similar to platforms like Dream11. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing player and team data. The frontend will utilize React to create an interactive user interface that allows users to select players, create teams, and view their total points.

Technical Architecture
Backend:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building the API.
Express.js: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store player and team data.
RESTful API Endpoints:
GET /players: Retrieve all available players.
POST /teams: Create a new team.
GET /teams/:id: Retrieve a specific team by ID.
Frontend:

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Form for Team Creation: Users can select players and create a team.
Player List Display: Show all available players with their attributes.
Team Management: Allow users to add players to their team (maximum of 11 players) and display the team details along with total points.
Challenges Faced:

Database Connection: Ensuring a successful connection to MongoDB was crucial. Proper error handling was implemented to catch connection issues.
Schema Design: Designing the player and team schemas to accurately represent the data structure required careful consideration.
Explanation:

Created Mongoose schemas for players and teams.
Players have attributes like name, points, and position.
Teams reference players by their IDs.
